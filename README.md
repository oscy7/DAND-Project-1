# DAND-Project-1

## First DAND Project - Analyzing Weather Patterns

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the tempterature trends of Los Angeles, CA USA to overall global temperature trends. 

## Summary 

* **Extract Data** from the database where I made a SQL query to extract city level data and global data and exported it to a CSV. 

* **Use Python** to open the CSV.

* **Create a line Chart** that compares city's temperature with global temperature.

* **Make Observations** about the similarities and differences between world averages and city's averages.
